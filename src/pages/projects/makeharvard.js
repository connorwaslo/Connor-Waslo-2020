      <BlogText>Make Harvard is a hackathon which requires you to build something physical and not just software.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>My team designed and built a robotic arm which is controlled entirely by pupil motion. Our intention
      was that this could be used by those with physical disabilities to still express their creative side.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>I was responsible for developing the pupil-tracking part of the project. The hardest part of this was
      getting all the correct dependencies installed on my computer. From there it just took some playing around with
      pre-built eye tracking models and sending the right data to the arduinos.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>Unfortunately, we built the arms way too long for the tiny motors we had and the range of motion was...
      subpar.</BlogText>
      <BlogText>We may not have won, but this was a great learning experience.</BlogText>
