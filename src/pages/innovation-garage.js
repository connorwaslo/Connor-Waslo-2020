        Sophomore year at Vanderbilt I was lucky enough to participate in Innovation Garage: a
        yearlong consulting project identifying an opportunity and developing a tech solution for
        a large corporate client.

      <BlogHeader>What's Innovation Garage? üí°</BlogHeader>
      <BlogText>
        Innovation Garage is a selective program at Vanderbilt University where a small team of students
        work closely with a company to identify opportunity for innovation and develop a solution.

      <BlogText>
        We lead the process all the way from ideation to product development.

      <BlogText>
        This program placed huge emphasis on the <i>design thinking process</i>.

        I didn‚Äôt know any of my team members when the project began in August, but we were tossed right into the fire.
        Our student team led weekly meetings with the RGP team to summarize progress and plan next steps.

      <BlogText>
        To begin our process we needed to interview employees. I was responsible for reaching out to employees
        (across all different roles) and scheduling interviews.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        It was a mild shock to be emailing C-Suite executives to schedule interviews, but <InlineRef to='/hostmost'>hostmost</InlineRef> taught me
        to be comfortable with outreach like that.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        These interviews taught us so much about the different roles, employee experiences, and personalities at
        the firm.

      <BlogText>
        Our team then consolidated the interview insights along with external white papers to group our discoveries into
        overlapping categories ‚Äì building an idea map to find the optimal intersection between problem areas.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        While this map was useful in narrowing down the vertical(s) we intended to hone in on, it didn‚Äôt help us address
        specific issues. That is, it didn‚Äôt show us how these areas correlated with RGP employees and their experience
        at RGP.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        To do that, we used our research to build a journey map plotting the life cycle of certain employees.

      <BlogHeader>Ideate ü§Ø</BlogHeader>
      <BlogText>
        Our team‚Äôs advisors were essential in helping us get to this stage in a smart and constructive way.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        It‚Äôs easy to come up with ideas. It‚Äôs hard to do the work to inform your ideation process and come up with an
        idea that you‚Äôre positive people want.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        By the time we reached the ideation phase we had accumulated enough research and spoken with so many employees
        that it seemed easy to put ourselves in the shoes of employees and imagine what sort of solutions we would want
        to address our concerns.
      </BlogText>
      <BlogText>
        Finally, we used our research to recommend a tech solution. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt elaborate on the specifics.
