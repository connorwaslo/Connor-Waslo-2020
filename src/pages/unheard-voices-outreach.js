        Sophomore year of college (2019 - 2020) I was a project manager for Change++, a student
        organization that builds software for non-profits at no cost.

        I worked with Rahim Buford from <InlineLink href=''>Unheard Voices Outreach</InlineLink> to
        create a mobile app connecting individuals coming out of incarceration to relevant resoureces and mentors

        Working on this project has been incredibly rewarding. UVO's mission to end felonism and reduce
        recidivism has made developing their app both rewarding and enjoyable.

        This project showed me that starting with "why" is the best way to both give the team a clear image
        of the product vision and to motivate the team to see that vision through.

        I jumped on a call with Rahim, the founder of UVO, to hear his story and to learn about his vision. I
        can’t express just how inspiring Rahim is. His vision for being able to help people coming out of the prison
        system in a scalable manner was incredible to hear.

        I came out of this call fired up -- ready to get building.

        Next steps were to create a project spec outlining the features we would include in their minimum viable product,
        the tech stack that we intended to use, and what we expected that timeline to look like.

        After getting the UVO team’s approval, we began developing low fidelity mockups. Keep in mind, this is a team of engineers
        and at the time we had very little design experience and had yet to work together. I'll emphasize
        the <i>low fidelity</i> point one more time.

      <BlogText>
        Our tech stack was React-Native and Firebase. I used Jira to manage the team's week long sprints.

        Everything progressed smoothly until March when we were all asked to leave campus due to the COVID crisis. This
        threw a wrench in our workflow to say the least.

      <BlogText>
        We're currently finalizing the app before deploying it to the app store.

        Updates on the final product coming soon.
